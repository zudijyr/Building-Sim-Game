# Building-Sim-Game
2D Builder/Resource management game

Currently (Feb 2016) in active development, but not really playable except as a demo.

Setup instructions:
First, install a virtual environment like this: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ , but with Python 3.
It will not work with Python 2!

source it, then pip install pyglet and pynum
python setup.py develop
install pyglet-gui from here: https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/pyglet-gui
finally, python setup.py develop
and then you can run it- bin/run-game

The units start with some commands "pre-loaded" but you can also interrupt them and direct them as you wish.
Right now it's just a demo though so there isn't much to do.
